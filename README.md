# HeartDisease-Predictor using MachineLearning
Machine learning models for heart disease prediction, evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC.

This repository contains a machine learning project for **heart disease prediction** using the [UCI Heart Disease dataset](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sharmaroshan/Heart-UCI-Dataset/master/heart.csv).  
The goal is to classify patients as having **heart disease (1)** or **no heart disease (0)** using various machine learning algorithms.

## 📊 Project Overview
- **Dataset**: UCI Heart Disease Dataset  
- **Features**: Patient health-related attributes (age, sex, cholesterol, blood pressure, etc.)  
- **Target**:  
  - `1` → Heart disease present  
  - `0` → No heart disease
